### What I learned

HTML Structure: I gained a deeper understanding of structuring HTML elements to create a cohesive layout. For example, using semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer> to organize content.

CSS Styling: I practiced applying CSS styles to achieve the desired visual appearance of the website. This included setting background colors, fonts, margins, padding, and borders to enhance the overall design.

Responsive Design: I learned how to make the website responsive by using media queries to adjust styles based on the screen size. This ensures that the site looks good and functions well on various devices, from desktops to smartphones.

Overall, working on this project helped me reinforce my HTML and CSS skills, understand the importance of responsive design and gaining more confidence to tackle new projects.
